"""Granule boundary-band extraction (V1.70 · P5) — pure, Qt-free.

From the labeled granule voxels (P4), grow an **outward** boundary band of
thickness ``N`` around each granule: the voxels within ``N`` of a granule's
surface whose label is **not** that granule — i.e. *"the direction that there is
not the same value"*, which is background **and** neighbouring granules (P0
decision 9). The band masks the raw / DVC volume so the matrix immediately
surrounding each granule can be recovered and correlated.

Two band constructions are offered (``params["band_method"]``):

* ``"dilation"`` (default) — a **voxel-count** band. ``binary_dilation`` of the
  granule mask by ``N`` iterations with a 6-connectivity (face) structuring
  element, minus the granule itself, intersected with "not this granule". The
  6-connectivity element is deliberate: iterating it ``N`` times grows the mask
  by taxicab distance ``≤ N`` and makes the band agree with the ``edt`` method at
  ``N = 1`` on isotropic voxels.
* ``"edt"`` — a **metric** band honouring anisotropic voxel size. The Euclidean
  distance transform of the granule's complement (with ``sampling=(dz,dy,dx)``)
  gives each voxel's µm distance to the surface; the band keeps voxels with
  ``0 < edt <= threshold`` where ``threshold`` is ``band_um`` when set, else
  ``N * min(dz, dy, dx)``.

Combined band-label volume: every band voxel is painted with its source granule
id. When a voxel falls in **two** bands, the tie-break is *nearest surface* — the
granule whose surface is closer (smaller EDT distance) wins; on an exact tie (or
equal distance), the **lowest granule id** wins (granules are processed in
ascending id order with a strict ``<`` comparison, so an equal-distance later id
never displaces an already-claimed voxel).

Pure backend — **no PySide6** (backend-purity rule). ``scipy.ndimage`` is a hard
dependency here as elsewhere in this package (see ``mask3d`` /
``distance_transform_edt``).

        the ``include_neighbors=False`` background-only restriction.
    voxel_size_um:
