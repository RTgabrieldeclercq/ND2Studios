"""QThread worker for analysis pipelines.

.. deprecated:: V1.37

    New analysis code should submit to
    :class:`nd2studios.compute.runner.JobRunner` via
    :class:`nd2studios.compute.PipelinePreviewJob` /
    :class:`nd2studios.compute.PipelineCommitJob` instead of
    instantiating this worker directly. The runner gives us
    key-based coalescing, a proper :class:`CancellationToken`,
    and coordinated app-exit shutdown.

    The class itself is retained because no out-of-tree caller
    has been audited; removing it is deferred to a later version.
